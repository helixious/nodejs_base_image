**Node.js**  is an  [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software"),  [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform "Cross-platform"),  [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript")  runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for  [server-side scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting "Server-side scripting")â€”running scripts server-side to produce  [dynamic web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page "Dynamic web page")  content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying  [web-application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application "Web application")  development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.

Though  `.js`  is the standard  [filename extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension "Filename extension")  for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an  [event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture "Event-driven architecture")  capable of  [asynchronous I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O "Asynchronous I/O"). These design choices aim to optimize  [throughput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput "Throughput")  and  [scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability "Scalability")  in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for  [real-time Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Web "Real-time Web")  applications (e.g.,  [real-time communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_communication "Real-time communication")  programs and  [browser games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_game "Browser game")).
